On the 2nd day , I learnt about operators that are used in Python.

1. Addition : + 
2. Subtraction : -
3. Multiplication : *
4. Division : / (give quotient with decimals if any)
5. Modulus : % (gives remainder)
6. Exponent : ** (gives power)
7. Floor Division : // (gives quotient without decimals, only the floor value)

Typecasting: Conversion of one data type into the other type
2 types : Explicit (developers have to do) and Implicit (Python Interpreter does automatically on the basis of order value of the datatypes)

Taking user input in Python: Using input() function.
It gives a return value as a string or character. Whenever a variable takes input using input() function, it will be taken as a string input. 
e.g: variable = input() --> Variable will contain a string
     variable = input("Enter message")
     variable = int(input()) -->  Variable will contain an integer.


Strings:- A sequence or array of textual data. They are generally between single quote or double quote. 
          For multiline string, triple single/double quotes are used. 

          a) Access characters in a string : 
                  e.g name="Anant"
                      print(name[0]) (Output will be A)

          b) Looping through the string :
                  e.g for character in name:
                          print(character)
          
          c) Slicing of strings :
                 e.g name[0:3] --> 0 index included, 3 index not included
                     name[-3:-1] --> name[len(name)-3:len(name)-1]
           
          d) Length of string: len() function returns the length of the string.999
